schema: spec-driven

# Project context (optional)
# This is shown to AI when creating artifacts.
# Add your tech stack, conventions, style guides, domain knowledge, etc.
context: |
  Tech stack: Java 17, Spring Boot, Maven, Oracle DB, Cucumber (BDD testing)
  Architecture: Hexagonal/Clean Architecture with ports and adapters
  Package structure: es.um.example.demo
  
  Domain: Example API for University of Murcia
  - Todo: Task management (CRUD for tasks, with status and priority)
  
  API base path: /example/demo
  API style: RESTful with JSON payloads, HATEOAS links where appropriate, documentes with OpenAPI/Swagger
  Testing: Cucumber with JUnit 5, MockServer for 3rd party services
  Code style: Follow Google Java Style Guide, use Lombok for boilerplate reduction, prefer immutability and functional programming where possible

  Code conventions:
  - Use CQRS pattern (Command/Query handlers)
  - Domain-driven design with entities in domain/model
  - Spring Data JPA for persistence
  - Spring Security OAuth2 for authentication
  - Add comments in spanish when logic is complex or non-obvious
  - Uses TDD approach, starting with failing tests before implementation

# Per-artifact rules (optional)
# Add custom rules for specific artifacts.
rules:
  proposal:
    - Focus on University of Murcia teaching guide workflow
    - Consider legacy system migration requirements
    - Write in Spanish for domain-specific terms and comments
    - Use also spanish for change proposal descriptions and commit messages
  tasks:
    - Break into 2 hour chunks
    - Include database migration scripts if needed
    - Start with cucumber feature files in spanish for BDD testing
    - Use TDD approach, writing tests before implementation and using in memory HSQLDB database for testing
  code:
    - Follow hexagonal architecture principles
    - Use Spring Boot best practices
    - Ensure code is clean, maintainable, and well-documented
